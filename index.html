        <h1><b class="heading">5 Indian Players who need to Move in January Transfer Window</b></h1>
        <h6>11 Jan 2023 | Written By Shyam Sundar</h6>
        <img class="prev" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FmMrvtmaMAAKGpP?format=jpg&name=large" alt="" height=400px>
        <br>
        <p>
          The Winter transfer window is now open and a lot of moves has already happened in the Hero ISL. We saw Indian players like Puitea move to ATK Mohun Bagan, Alex Saji joining Northeast United FC on loan
          from Hyderabad FC and Hira Mondal also joining the Highlanders. But in this article, we will have a look at<strong> 5 Indian Players who has to change
            their clubs in order to revive their career.</strong>
          <br>
        <h4><b class="heading">Sumit Rathi - ATK Mohun Bagan</b></h4>
        <img class="prev" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FmNPk-6aEAIJ4GI?format=jpg&name=medium" alt="" height=400px>
        <p style="text-align:center">Image Courtesy : Sumit Rathi (Instagram)</p>
        <p>
          Sumit Rathi came through the ranks of AIFF Elite Academy before joining ATK FC (now ATK Mohun Bagan) reserves team in the 2018-19 season. Primarily a centre-back, Sumit can also
          operate as a left-back. Sumit had a breakthrough season in the 2019-20 season, where he was an integral part of ATK FC's title winning campaign. He also won the Emerging Player of the season
          award.
          <br>
          <br>
          But everything has went downhill since that, as Sumit managed to play only 253 minutes in the 2020-21 season and 61 minutes in the 2021-22 season.
          He has not featured even once for the Mariners in 12 games this season.
          <br>
          <br>
          With Pritam Kotal, Brendan Hamill, Slavko Damjanovic and Carl McHugh (can play CB/CDM) all ahead of him in the pecking order, it only makes sense for Sumit to begin a new chapter and revive his career.
        </p>

        <h4><b class="heading">Aniket Jadhav - East Bengal FC</b></h4>
        <img class="prev" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FmMrx2ZaMAcmitj?format=jpg&name=medium" alt="" height=400px>
        <p style="text-align:center">Image Courtesy : Aniket Jadhav (Instagram)</p>
        <p>
          Just a year back, Aniket Jadhav was having a great season playing an integral part in Hyderabad FC's title triumph. The winger had 2 goals and 3 assists in 20 appearances following his move from
          Jamshedpur FC. His good perfomances was rewarded with a National Team call-up by Igor Stimac for friendlies against Bahrain and Belarus.
          <br>
          <br>
          Aniket moved to East Bengal FC in the summer transfer window for a fee of around 10 lakhs. The move has not panned out in the way everyone expected it to be. Aniket has 0 starts in ISL this season
          and has played only 166 minutes in 5 appearances this season. He was once sent to train with the reserves team by head coach Stephen Constantine.
          <br>
          <br>
          With Stephen Constantine not showing faith in Aniket, it might be good for Aniket to get a loan move to any other ISL club for the remainder of the season.
        </p>
        <h4><b class="heading">Devendra Murgaonkar - FC Goa</b></h4>
        <img class="prev" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FmMrwqDagAIAf9g?format=jpg&name=medium" alt="" height=400px>
        <p style="text-align:center">Image Courtesy : Devendra Murgaonkar (Instagram)</p>
        <p>
          Devendra came through the ranks of Salgoacar before joinig FC Goa in 2020. He was one of the impact players under Juan Ferrando who placed a lot of faith on the goan lad.
          He featured 13 times in 2020-21 ISL season scoring a goal and 5 times in AFC Champions League. He was the top-scorer in 2021 Durand Cup guiding FC Goa to their maiden Durand Cup.
          The Indian striker had 4 goal contributions in the 2021-22 season with 2 goals and 2 assists.
          <br>
          <br>
          But this season has been a tough one for Devendra as he is behind Noah Sadaoui and Alvaro Vazquez in the pecking order. He has played only 47 minutes in 6 appearances this season under Carlos Pena.
          A move in this transfer window might help him regain his form and establish himself once again.
        </p>
        <h4><b class="heading">Mohammad Nawaz - Mumbai City FC</b></h4>
        <img class="prev" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FmMryndaAAI-IUr?format=jpg&name=medium" alt="" height=400px>
        <p style="text-align:center">Image Courtesy : Mohammad Nawaz (Instagram)</p>
        <p>
          Nawaz joined the Islanders ahead of the 2021-22 season on a free transfer from FC Goa replacing Amrinder Singh who left for ATK Mohun Bagan. He played 17 times that season keeping 5 clean sheets.
          But Des Buckingham preferred Phurba Lachenpa for the Champions League games, with Nawaz getting only one start. This season Nawaz has not started in any of the ISL games and
          has appeared only twice in the Durand Cup. Currently, Nawaz finds himself as the third choice goalkeeper behind Phurba and Bhaskar Roy.
          <br>
          <br>
          With a couple of ISL clubs looking for first-choice goalkeeper, it only makes sense for Nawaz to go on loan or make a permanent switch to another club and get some minutes under his belt.
        </p>
        <h4><b class="heading">Mohamad Rakip - East Bengal FC</b></h4>
        <img class="prev" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FmNJ4sZaEAE9mrv?format=jpg&name=medium" alt="" height=400px>
        <p style="text-align:center">Image Courtesy : East Bengal FC Media</p>
        <p>
          East Bengal secured the services of Rakip this season even before finding an investor. The right-back joined the red and gold brigade on a two-year deal from Mumbai City FC with the hope of getting more game-time.
          But it has not been the case, as he has been limited to only 9 minutes in the league this season.
          <br>
          <br>
          He is the fourth choice right back according to head coach Constantine, who prefers Ankit Mukherjee, Sarthak Golui and Sumeet Passi ahead of Rakip. At 22, Rakip should be playing more
          which is why he has to make a loan move to another ISL outfit or an I-League club where he will get more gametime.
